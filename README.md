blog
====

Very bare bones Node.js blogging software (uses your static files based on created/modified times).

Changes to your own copy of the file "config.js" ought to negate the need to modify "index.js".

Code notes
=========

1. Extra dependencies: None (Already includes promised-io (fs and promise) dependency).
2. Contains simple html-boilerplate module and fairly robust Atom builder.
3. Utilities for XML string creation and date formatting.
4. Some sample data files
